# ClaytonVille
This pack was created as a custom resource pack for a command block mini game. The mini game features vibrant colorful levels without looking like typical minectraft. Stained Hardened Clay was exactly the right texture, but limited to only 16 colors. What started out as just a re-texture of wool blocks turned into a mass re-texturing to facilitate adding greater color variations.

## Not a Daily Driver
Again, this pack was created replace the typical minecraft look. It's niche is certainly more useful to creatives what wish for a cleaner color pallet, or map makers that want to build colorful levels preserving the color of minecraft, but not interested in the vanilla textures. This pack **IS NOT** intended to be something you play minecraft with. This pack would be horrible to mine in :D

## Completeness
Currently I would guess that ClaytonVille is about 50% complete. Because this was created initially as something for a different project, some blocks are not color accurate, but rather close to what I needed and it was easy for me to remember the association. Also, not every block is converted at this point. I plan to fully convert blocks and release updates as I go. 

## Feedback
Assuming people find this pack interesting and useful, I invite the community to provide feedback or make a pull request with their changes.
