# ClaytonVille
This pack was created as a custom resource pack for a creative builders and map makers, specifically mini game creators. ClaytonVille takes the vibrant color and purity of hardened clay and extends the look into many other blocks creating a wide gamut of colors to choose from for your custom maps. 

ClaytonVille aims to keep a certain level of the traditional vanilla look with it's 16x16 texture, while creating a very diverse color pallet in which to create harmonious and cohesive maps.  ClaytonVille also looks great when used to show of creative builds, especially those that are whimsical and colorful by nature.

In addition to extending the stained hardened clay texture to other blocks, the colors for many of the blocks were created to look similar to that in vanilla minecraft. For example, Acacia stairs, planks and slabs all conform to the vanilla color. This means a build that uses blocks for color and tonal variation are well preserved or enhanced with the ClaytonVille resource pack. 

Some colors like those in wool or in stained clay were modified to create a more harmonious balance in color. e.g. Lime green wool was toned down so as not to be a digital green but rather a green that fits nicer with green and lime clay. Some colors were saturated or made to appear more colorful like red stained clay, it looked great before, but the slight color correction to saturation made a huge difference in how colors connected with one another.

## Not a Daily Driver
I created this pack for mini game level development where I wanted a broad color pallet that was not distracting to players, devoid of strong textures. Illustrative or cartoonish is what I had in mind. It's niche is certainly more useful to creatives what wish for a cleaner color pallet, or map makers that want to build colorful levels preserving the color of minecraft, but not interested in the vanilla textures. This pack **IS NOT** intended to be something you play minecraft with. This pack would be horrible to go mining with :D

## Completeness
Currently I would estimate that ClaytonVille is about 50% complete. Because this was created initially as a resource pack for my mini games, some blocks are not color accurate, but rather close to what I needed and it was easy for me to remember the association. Also, not every block is converted at this point. I plan to fully convert blocks and release updates as I go. 

## Feedback
Assuming people find this pack interesting and useful, I invite the community to provide feedback or make a pull request with their changes.
